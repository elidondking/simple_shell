Output
s specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)

Example of error with sh:



$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh

/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh

/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found

$


Same error with your program hsh:
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh

./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found

$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh

./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
